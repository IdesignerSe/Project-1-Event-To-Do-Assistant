📌 Event Todo Assistant — Console App (C# / .NET)

## Project Brief ##
A lightweight, structured, productivity‑focused console application for managing tasks, events, and AI‑generated suggestions.
Built in C# / .NET, designed for clarity, modularity, and future AI integration (Cloud AI or Local LLM via Ollama).

🚀 Features (Current Stage)

✅ Task Management

Add tasks with:

Title

Project

Priority

Description

🤖 AI Suggestions (Mock AI for now)
Generate event‑based suggestions using a mock AI engine

Save suggestions as tasks

Delete suggestions

Save all suggestions at once

Architecture prepared for:

Cloud AI (OpenAI / Azure OpenAI / Claude / Groq)

Local AI (Ollama, LM Studio, GPT4All)

🧠 AI Integration Roadmap
The project is already structured to support multiple AI providers:

🔹 1. Mock AI (current)
Used for development and offline testing.

🔹 2. Cloud AI (planned)
Planned support for:

OpenAI API

Azure OpenAI

Claude

Groq

Mistral

🔹 3. Local AI (planned)
Planned support for:

Ollama 

LM Studio

GPT4All

llama.cpp

The IAIService interface allows switching AI providers with one line of code.
